Instagram clone _SQL database
Aim of the project is to create an Instagram clone to study the relationship between tables and to implement SQL queries to retrieve data from multiple tables based on real time scenarios.
file "ig_clone.sql" creates new database and insert tables into the newly created database.
"table_Data.sql" enters the data into all creaeted tables
"manipulation.sql" contains the sql queries to retrieve data based on the various conditions.


note* This is not an actual INSTAGRAM database. The database is just created with few tables to study the interrelation between various tables.
